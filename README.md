## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Got to learn more on CSS grids.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class=container></div>
```
```css
.container {
    background-color: blue;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    border-radius:25px;
  }
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I wil continue learning Front-End development and Build cool and responsive webpages by challenging myself and doing hard things.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for CSS Grids. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
