Got to learn more on CSS grids.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class=container></div>
```
```css
.container {
    background-color: blue;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    border-radius:25px;
  }
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
